## Type Casting

- Smaller types automatically casted to bigger types. 
- byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double
- Explicit type casting is required to assign bigger types to smaller ones.
- Beware of overflow while type casting.
- Result of arthmetic operations on types smaller than int is an int.

```java
byte a = 127, b = 5;

// ‚ùå compilation fails
byte c = a + b;
int d = a + b;  // d = 132

// ‚ö†Ô∏è e is -124 (type overflow, because 127 is the max byte value)
byte e = (byte) (a + b);

// ‚ö†Ô∏è f is 25 ( a/b is 25 because it is an int)
int f = a / b;

// ‚ö†Ô∏è g is 25.0F (result of a/b )
float g = a / b; 

// ‚ö†Ô∏è h is 25.0F (explicitly casted to float, but a/b is still 25)
float h = (float) (a/b);

// ‚úÖ when either a or b
float i = (float) a / b;

// ‚ö†Ô∏è explicit casting is required, because b + 1 is an int
b = (byte) (b + 1);

b++;    // no casting is required for ++ and -- operators

char x = 'x'
char y = ++x;   // arithmetic operations work with char codes
```
